# Recipes Interactive Dashboard from [scraped data from food.com](https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions)

This is the 2nd project for the 2021-2022 Big Blue Data Academy Bootcamp. For this project we had to build an interactive dashboard using dash and plotly with Python

The dashboard is live and running on Heroku!

Visit https://recipes-dash-bigblue.herokuapp.com/ and have fun exploring recipes and facts about ingredients!
